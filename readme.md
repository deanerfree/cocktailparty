# drinkapp

Hello, this is an app I decided to create with React that was simple, fun, and scalable. But gave me a chance to learn about 3rd party API's and how to incorporate them into my app

To Run:

1. Clone Repository into your code editor of choice
2. npm install to install all suporting libraries
3. npm run

Things I plan on doing with the app:
1. Improving design
2. Adding Images
3. Personal Blog
4. Own API with Drink recipes I've tried and enjoyed... Maybe personal ranking system? 5stars?
5. Explanation of what makes a Whiskey sour a sour
6. Getting started with cocktails page... Cocktails 101
