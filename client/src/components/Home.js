          Why not? This site was designed to explore different cocktails and to
          learn about their history and what makes a modern cocktail versus a
          classic cocktail. The history behind some of these cocktails is
          interesting and gives you a glimpse into the history of that time.

        <h2>What are Cocktails?</h2>
        <p>
          A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a combination
          of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients such
          as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are various types of
          cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added.
          Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included spirits, liquers, sugar,
          water and bitters.
