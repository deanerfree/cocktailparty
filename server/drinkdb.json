      "history": "The Negroni is believed to have been created in Florence at Bar Casoni by an Italian Count 'Camillo Negroni' in the early 20th century. The Count demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by replacing the soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel.",
